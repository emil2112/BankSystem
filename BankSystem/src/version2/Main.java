/** This example demonstrates the foundations of building an object-oriented system in Java.
 *  It uses the domain of a bank
 *
 *
 *  adHoc_object_creation branch demonstrates the following subjects and techniques:
 *     Bank class
 *    - using the Scanner with a while loop for user dialog
 *    - Scanner bug
 *
 *    Main class
 *    - condition to check state of an array
 *
 *
 *  THINGS TO CONSIDER
 *
 *    The user can now add customers to the bank.
 *    But only if the list of customer objects is empty
 *    what if we want the user to add customers at various times during the session?
 *    what about other actions, like adding money to a customer's account?
 *    How could this be achieved?
